_*10 Delta Strangles*_ 

*Background*

	1. After trying various option strategies over the years, a few of us have fine-tuned this strategy to make regular income from options trading.
	2. Every strategy has it's pros and cons, this is no different - but the aim was to get to a strategy which doesn't need to be adjusted too often and will allow for peace of mind while generating decent returns.

*Choice of Instruments*

	1. Instrument chosen is Bank Nifty (BN) as it gives decent returns with higher IV (implied volatility)
	2. This can also be applied to most indices, just as long as they are liquid and don't tend to drop or raise more than 5-6% in a month. This is also the reason why this won't work on Stocks.
	
*Expectations*
	
	1. This is a purely selling strategy - profits will be small, but probability of getting a profit is extremely high - usually above 80%+
	2. On the con side, the losses (on paper) are unlimited. In most circumstances you will have enough time to get out/adjust before markets bite too much when things go wrong.
	3. Expect to win 10 out of 12 months. Rest months will be slight negative or breakeven
	4. Expect circa 2-2.5% monthly returns on OVERALL capital on account. If trading with 5L, expect to make 10K a month. If vix is higher, you might get more.
	5. Based on winning odds, you are likely to get 20-25% of overall capital over the year.
	6. This is not a get-rich-quick scheme but expect better returns than an FD + inflation! Compounding is key.
	7. Only few trades in a month. All trades are executed in the last 30 mins of the day.
	8. Expect to have peace of mind, regardless of market volatility :)

*When not to trade this strategy*
	
	1. Strategy depends on range bound markets
	2. Stay out of market when market moving events are coming up and volatility is expected (Budget/Elections/War outbreak/Pandemic or major court litigations results, etc)
	3. No trade is also a trade
	
*Who can trade*

	1. I would advise people who learn/understand options, and risks to capital. 
	2. You could lose huge chunks of your capital if you do this wrong or can't allocate time to adjust positions.
	3. Learn first, paper trade after, small capital next and only put in large money when you learn to trust the strategy and more importantly learn to control your emotions (i.e. avoid panic)
	4. Markets aren't going anywhere - take your time to understand what you are doing
	5. http://bit.ly/indopt is a good place to start if you don't understand options.


*The Strategy*

	1. Open 10 delta PE sell and 10 delta CE sell at 45 DTE. For BN this will be typically mid-month (Mid-Feb for March expiry, Mid-March for April expiry)
	2. 10 delta is approx. 1.6 SD. At 45 DTE, you are playing a wide range while letting theta kick in.
	3. If 10 delta isn't too liquid, look for 8-11 delta at a round strike (500s/1000s for BN)
	4. Expect to collect approx. Rs 100 premium on each leg - Rs 200 in total. This will vary based on Vix and skew. 
	5. Margin needed is circa 70K per lot, so hold 1L on account per lot to make it 70% funds usage.
	6. Additional margin is to make sure you aren't forced to close positions by your broker in case of volatility
	7. Max profit will come to 3%-6% (3% this is the lowest expectation seen when vix was around 11/12.
	Case 1 (Market is range bound and no adjustments are needed)
		a. Exit trade at 15 DTE 
		b. Expect to have 2-2.5% returns on 1L capital (70K deployed)
		c. Enter next month's trade at 45 DTE
	Case 2 (Market swings one way - Adjustment 1)
		a. Exit TESTED leg at 2x premium or if leg hits 20 delta. Only do this if condition is satisfied towards end of the day.
		b. Sell again for Rs 100 premium on the same side. Effectively, book loss of approx. Rs 100 and sell again on same side (far OTM) for same value. 
			i. Optional: Bring in untested side by booking profits and selling again for Rs 100 (10 delta). Important: don't get too close if you expect a reversal.
		c. Idea is to book small losses in return for a larger trading range.
		d. Expect to have 1-1.5% returns on 1L capital (70K deployed) by 15 DTE trade closure
	Case 3 (Market keeps riding same way - Adjustment 2)
		a. If leg sold in Case 2 (b) doubles again, close again for Rs 200 and sell again OTM for Rs 100. 
		b. Trade this only at close of play as this case is extremely unlikely. You are at 2nd adjustment - meaning markets have moved 2-3 SD from when you took the trade - it's time for some reversal.
			i. Optional: Bring in untested side again to book some profits and sell OTM 10 delta. Important: don't get too close when you expect a reversal.
		c. Expect to end month in slight -ve or breakeven (no profit no loss) by trade closure (15 DTE)
	Case 4 (Market still keeps riding same way - Adjustment 3)
		a. Don't try to fight the market - exit the tested side at 2x, wait for some consolidation and re-enter tested side for 1x
		b. Expect to end month in negative (worst case 2-3%) - no worries, there's always the next month!
	
*Pitfalls*

	1. Market will linger close to 2x many times, use 20 delta and market closing to decide whether to made adjustments
	2. MTM swings will be huge, but time is an Option seller's friend - stick to the rules and don't be tempted to adjust until the criteria fits (i.e. be disciplined)
	3. Don't be tempted to book profits and close in to ATM too often (if market is range bound) - it will come back to bite. Smaller profits is better than no profits.
	4. As long as you don't let your legs get close to ATM, you will win. ITM is a definite no-no.
